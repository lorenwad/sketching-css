      <div class="testimonials">
        <p>
          “I highly recommend it for developers and product builders. I was able
          to do good enough design myself, without much time or money, and
          successfully launch my product.” —Eric Davis, @edavis10
        </p>
        <p>
          “Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be
          accomplished by the talented few. That's a myth. Design is a skill
          that can be learned. It's also a process that can be
          reverse-engineered to a degree. Jarrod's book will give you a huge
          head start in both areas.”
